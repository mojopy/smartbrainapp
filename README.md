# Smarty Panty Brainos Projecto

Based off the final project of [Andrei Neagoie's on his Web Dev 2023: Zero to Mastery course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/). Written as I liked, customized as I felt like it.

The course thus far is perfect for me to "re-integrate" the programming world, I started in 2008, but practically stopped for many reasons in 2013. So I was extremely out-of-touch with a lot of the new, hot, modern and snappy ways to program things. This is helping me immensely to get that coding flame roar up once more and is instilling a lot of the modern idealogies of programming into me. 

Still in progress.
