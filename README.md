# Smarty Panty Brainos Projecto

Based off the final project of [Andrei Neagoie's on his Web Dev 2023: Zero to Mastery course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/). Written as I liked, customized as I felt like it.

The course was perfect for me to "re-integrate" the programming world, I started in 2008, but practically stopped for many reasons in 2013. So I was extremely out-of-touch with a lot of the new, hot, modern and snappy ways to program things. This helped me get that coding flame roast-up once more and instilled all the modern idealogies of programming into me. 

Programmed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using React, Node.js, Express.js, ... and using Machine Learning, and more.
